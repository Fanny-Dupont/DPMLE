# Improved order selection method for hidden Markov models


Repository for code from the paper: Improved order selection method for hidden Markov models: a case study with movement data.

The link to the paper is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18826).

# Overview

The repository consists of two parts. 


In the Simulation.R script, we provide functions to simulate data from various scenarios. We also provide details of the initialization and fitting process to select the best model using AIC and BIC criteria.

The [tutorial file](Code_DPMLE_MEE/Tutorial) provides .pdf and .rmd files on how to use the DPMLE, both stationary and non-stationary, on clipped narwhal data with a single track.
